        My name is Gabriel Bendotti or commonly known as "Blendotti". 
        I am a Barber based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
        I began cutting hair in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in January of 2021 and since then have found my passion in the art of Barbery. 
        You can find me at The Men's Club Barbershop located in the Roxborough/Manayunk area of Philadelphia or at Budâ€™s Barbershop located in South Philly (Tuesdays only). 
        I am really looking forward to my journey of creating amazing artwork and memories with all of my clients. 
        Book me today to join me on the journey and become more than just a life long client..{" "}
